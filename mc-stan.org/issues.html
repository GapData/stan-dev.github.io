  <p>Stan uses an issue tracker for reporting and monitoring progress
  on bug fixes and feature requests.  Bugs include bugs in Stan, its
  interfaces, installation, sample models, or documentation typos or
  brainos.</p>

  <p>Users can report bugs or request features by mailing the <a
  class="internal" href="groups.html">user's group</a> or by opening
  an issue on the issue tracker:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a class="external"
    href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/issues">Issue Tracker</a><img
    class="external" src="external-link.png" alt="external pdf
    marker"/>
    <span class="note">[on Stan's GitHub]</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The rest of this page explains how to report bugs or request
  features to make it easy for the development team to respond.</p>

  <p>If you have reported a bug and not gotten a response, please
  remind the developers through the user's mailing list.</p>
  
  <h2>How to Report Bugs</h2>

  <p>The key to a successful bug report is to provide as much context as
  possible.  Ideally, this will be in the form of a small example that
  allows the developers to easily reproduce the bug.</p>

  <p>Installation issues should be discussed on the user's group; some
  of these may be promoted to bugs or feature requests depending on
  their root cause.</p>

  <p>Documentation typos, brainos, or requests for more information
  may reported either on the user's list or issue tracker.  Reports
  should include the name of the document or web site and version as
  well as page numbers or a link.</p>

  <p>Modeling issues that have not been isolated to small reproducible
  examples should first be discussed on the user's group.</p>

  <p>Bugs that have been isolated to reproducible examples may be
  reported on the user's list or issue tracker.  Bug reports should
  include information about</p>
  <ul>
    <li> interface (RStan, PyStan, CmdStan) with version,</li>
    <li> underlying language version (R, Python, Shell)</li>
    <li> language byte size (32 or 64 bit),</li>
    <li> operating system (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) with version,</li>
    <li> memory available, and</li>
    <li> compiler (clang++, g++) with version.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most importantly, it is almost impossible to diagnose a bug
  without the</p>
  <ul>
    <li>full model file and data that produces the bug.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Request Features</h2>

  <p>The Stan developers are happy to field feature requests from
  users.  Feature requests can be for new functions to support, new
  samplers, support for platforms, etc.  Please provide as much
  information as possible, including links to papers or formulas.</p>

  <p>Feature requests should be made either on the user's group or
  using the issue tracker.</p>
