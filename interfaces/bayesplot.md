plotting for Bayesian models

The bayesplot package <span class="note">(R)</span> provides a variety of
ggplot2-based plotting functions for use after fitting Bayesian models
(typically, though not exclusively, via MCMC). The package is designed not only
to provide convenient functionality for users, but also a common set of
functions that can be easily used by developers working on a variety of R
packages for Bayesian modeling, particularly (but not necessarily) packages
powered by RStan.
