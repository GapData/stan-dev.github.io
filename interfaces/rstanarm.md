RStanARM allows users to specify models via the customary R commands
and data structures; models are specified with formula syntax, data is
provided as a data frame, and additional arguments are available to
specify priors.  Estimation may be carried out with Markov chain Monte
Carlo, variational inference, or optimization (Laplace approximation).
Graphical posterior predictive checking, leave-one-out
cross-validation, and posterior visualization are tightly integrated.

RStanARM runs under Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, and is open source
licensed under the GNU PUblic License, version 3 (GPLv3).
