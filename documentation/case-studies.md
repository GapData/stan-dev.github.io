*Date:* &nbsp; 2014
<br />
*Abstract:* &nbsp; This case study provides ordinary differential equation-based compartment models of soil carbon flux, with experimental data fitted with unknown initial compartment balance and noisy CO<sub>2</sub> measurements.  Results form Sierra and Müller’s (2014) soilR package are replicated.
